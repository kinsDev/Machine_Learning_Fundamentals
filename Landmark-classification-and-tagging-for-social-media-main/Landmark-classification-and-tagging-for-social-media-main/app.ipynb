This is because the exported model, differently from the model weights, is a standalone serialization of our model and therefore it does not need anything else. You can ship that file to anybody, and as long as they can import ``torch``, they will be able to use your model. This is very important for releasing pytorch models to production.\n","\n","### Test your app\n","Go to a search engine for images (like Google Images) and search for images of some of the landmarks, like the Eiffel Tower, the Golden Gate Bridge, Machu Picchu and so on.
